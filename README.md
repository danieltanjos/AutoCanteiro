# **Automated Construction Site Layout Generator (UFSC)**  

This project was developed in collaboration with Jo√£o Vitor Pedro (https://github.com/jvfpedro) for the *Computational Tools for Civil Engineering* course at the **Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Brazil**.  

The goal is to automate the generation of construction site layouts, ensuring compliance with **NR18 safety regulations** and optimizing the spatial arrangement of essential site elements such as storage, restrooms, and dining areas.  

## **Project Overview**  

This Python-based application generates optimized construction site layouts using a **genetic algorithm**. It takes into account:  
- Site dimensions (width and height)  
- Number of workers  
- Safety standards (NR18)  
- Essential site elements (storage, restrooms, dining areas)  

The final layout is exported as a **DXF file**, which can be opened and edited in CAD software such as AutoCAD or LibreCAD.  

## **Main Features**  

### **Graphical User Interface (customtkinter)**  
- Simple interface for entering project parameters  
- Selection of required site elements  
- Directory selection for saving the generated DXF file  

### **Optimized Layout via Genetic Algorithm**  
- Uses an evolutionary approach to find the best spatial arrangement  
- Prevents overlapping blocks and ensures logical placement  

### **DXF File Generation**  
- Automatically generates a DXF file with the final layout  
- Ensures CAD compatibility for further adjustments

## **How to Run the Project**  

### **1. Install Dependencies**  
Make sure you have **Python 3.12.4** installed, then run:  
```bash
pip install ezdxf customtkinter
```

### **2. Clone the Repository & Navigate to Folder**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/danieltanjos/automated-construction-site.git  
cd automated-construction-site  
```

### **3. Run the Application**  
```bash
python main.py
```

### **4. Use the Interface**  
1. Fill in the required fields (site dimensions, workers, etc.)  
2. Select the elements to include (storage, restrooms, etc.)  
3. Choose a directory for saving the DXF file  
4. Click "Execute" to generate the layout

## **Example Usage**  

### **Input Parameters:**  
- **Project Name:** Example Project  
- **Site Dimensions:** 100m x 50m  
- **Number of Workers:** 30  
- **Selected Blocks:** Storage, Restrooms, Dining Area  

### **Generated Output:**  
A **DXF file** containing the optimized construction site layout is saved in the selected directory.

## **Future Improvements**  

- Refine the genetic algorithm for better optimization  
- Add more block types, such as offices and resting areas  
- Fix potential layout bugs, including block overlap and zero-score generations  
- Improve DXF output by adjusting scale and layout for better visualization  
- Convert the project into a standalone executable (.exe)
